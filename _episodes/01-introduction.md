Welcome to the Data Skills for Education Researchers workshop! At Data Carpentry, we normally run workshops over the course of 2-3 full days, so this workshop will go faster and cover less than we would in a typical workshop. However, we will otherwise run this as we run all Carpentry workshops. This means that:

1. We have a [Code of Conduct](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/) that we expect all in attendance to abide by.

2. Learners should all have two sticky notes in two different colors. These sticky notes can be used as little flags on your computer screen. One color indicates "I'm doing fine and am ready to proceed" and the other color indicates "I'm stuck or getting behind." Your instructor might call for learners to post stickies at various points; you can also use these to attract a helper's attention at any point during the workshop.

3. There are helpers! They are here to help you! The more help you get, the more useful they feel. Win-win! They might even know where the bathrooms are.

4. This workshop has an etherpad. Please add your name to the etherpad to register your attendance at this workshop. Your instructor may also use it to post links or for collaborative communication during the workshop. The etherpad is located here:  http://pad.software-carpentry.org/saber-west-2018
