## Creating a Project


Start the program. (Double-click on the openrefine.exe file (or google-refine.exe if using an older version). Java services will start on your machine, and OpenRefine will open in your browser).

Launch OpenRefine (see [Getting Started with OpenRefine](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/00-getting-started/)).

OpenRefine can import a variety of file types, including tab separated (`tsv`), comma separated (`csv`), Excel (`xls`, `xlsx`), JSON, XML, RDF as XML, Google Spreadsheets. See the [OpenRefine Importers page](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Importers) for more information.

In this first step, we'll browse our computer to the sample data file for this lesson. In this case, we modified the `Portal_rodents` CSV file, adding several columns: `scientificName`, `locality`, `county`, `state`, `country` and generating several more columns in the lesson itself (`JSON`, `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude`). Data in `locality`, `county`, `country`, `JSON`, `decimalLatitude` and `decimalLongitude` are contrived and are in no way related to the original dataset. 

If you haven't already, download the data from:  
[https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341)

Once OpenRefine is launched in your browser, the left margin has options to `Create Project`, `Open Project`, or `Import Project`. Here we will create a new project:

1. click `Create Project` and select `Get data from` `This Computer`.  
2. Click `Choose Files` and select the file `Portal_rodents_19772002_scinameUUIDs.csv`. Click `Open` or double-click on the filename.
3. Click `Next>>` under the browse button to upload the data into OpenRefine.  
4. OpenRefine gives you a preview - a chance to show you it understood the file. If, for example, your file was really tab-delimited, the preview might look strange, you would choose the correct separator in the box shown and click `Update Preview` (bottom left). If this is the wrong file, click `<<Start Over` (upper left).  
5. If all looks well, click `Create Project>>` (upper right). 

Note that at step 1, you could upload data in a standard form from a web address by selecting `Get data from` `Web Addresses (URLs)`. However, this won't work for all URLs.

## Faceting

*Exploring data by applying multiple filters*

OpenRefine supports faceted browsing as a mechanism for

* seeing a big picture of your data, and
* filtering down to just the subset of rows that you want to change in bulk.

Typically, you create a facet on a particular column. The facet summarizes the cells in that column to give you a big picture of that column, and allows you to filter to some subset of rows for which the cells in that column satisfy some constraint. That's a bit abstract, so let's jump into some examples. 

[More on faceting](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Faceting)

Here we will use faceting to look for potential errors in data entry in the `scientificName` column.

1. Scroll over to the `scientificName` column.
2. Click the down arrow and choose `Facet` > `Text facet`.
3. In the left panel, you'll now see a box containing every unique value in the `scientificName` column 
along with a number representing how many times that value occurs in the column.
4. Try sorting this facet by name and by count. Do you notice any problems with the data? What are they?
5. Hover the mouse over one of the names in the `Facet` list. You should see that you have an `edit` function available. 
6. You could use this to fix an error immediately, and OpenRefine will ask whether you want to make the same correction to every value it finds like that one. But OpenRefine offers even better ways to find and fix these errors, which we'll use instead. We'll learn about these when we talk about clustering.

> ## Solution
> 
> There will be several near-identical entries in `scientificName`. For example, there is one entry for `Ammospermophilis harrisi` and
> one entry for `Ammospermophilus harrisii`. These are both misspellings of `Ammospermophilus harrisi`. We will see how to correct these 
> misspelled and mistyped entries in a later exercise.  
{: .solution}

> ## Exercise
>
> 1. Using faceting, find out how many years are represented in the census.  
>
> 2. Is the column formatted as Number, Date, or Text? How does changing the format change the faceting display?
>
> 3. Which years have the most and least observations?
> 
> > ## Solution

> > 1. For the column `yr` do `Facet` > `Text facet`. A box will appear in the left panel showing that there are 26 unique entries in

> > 2. By default, the column `yr` is formatted as Text. You can change the format by doing `Edit cells` > `Common transforms` >

> > 3. After creating a facet, click `Sort by count` in the facet box. The year with the most observations is 1997. The least is 1977.

## Clustering

In OpenRefine, clustering means "finding groups of different values that might be alternative representations of the same thing". For example, the two strings `New York` and `new york` are very likely to refer to the same concept and just have capitalization differences. Likewise, `GÃ¶del` and `Godel` probably refer to the same person. Clustering is a very powerful tool for cleaning datasets which contain misspelled or mistyped entries. OpenRefine has several clustering algorithms built in. Experiment with them, and learn more about these algorithms and how they work. 

1. In the `scientificName` Text Facet we created in the step above, click the `Cluster` button.
2. In the resulting pop-up window, you can change the `Method` and the `Keying Function`. Try different combinations to 
see what different mergers of values are suggested.
3. Select the `key collision` method and `metaphone3` keying function. It should identify three clusters. 
4. Click the `Merge?` box beside each, then click `Merge Selected and Recluster` to apply the corrections to the dataset.
4. Try selecting different `Methods` and `Keying Functions` again, to see what new merges are suggested. You may find there are 
still improvements that can be made, but don't `Merge` again; just `Close` when you're done.  We'll now 
see other operations that will help us detect and correct the remaining problems, and that have other, more general uses.

Important: If you `Merge` using a different method or keying function, or more times than described in the instructions above, 
your solutions for later exercises will not be the same as shown in those exercise solutions.

## Scripts

As you conduct your data cleaning and preliminary analysis, OpenRefine saves every change you make to the dataset. These 
changes are saved in a format known as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). You can export this JSON script and apply it to other data files. If you had 20 files to clean, and they all had the same type of errors (e.g. species name misspellings, leading white spaces), and all
files had the same column names, you could save the JSON script, open a new file to clean in OpenRefine, paste in the script and run it.
This gives you a quick way to clean all of your related data.

1. In the `Undo / Redo` section, click `Extract...`, and select the steps that you want to apply to other datasets by clicking the check boxes. 
2. Copy the code from the right hand panel and paste it into a text editor (like NotePad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac). Make sure it saves as a plain text file. In TextEdit, do this by selecting `Format` > `Make plain text` and save the file as a `txt` file. 

Let's practice running these steps on a new dataset. We'll test this on an uncleaned version of the dataset we've been working with. 

1. Download an uncleaned version of the dataset: [https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7823341) or use the version of the raw dataset you saved to your computer.  
2. Start a new project in OpenRefine with this file and name it something different from your existing project.  
3. Click the `Undo / Redo` tab > `Apply` and paste in the contents of `txt` file with the JSON code. 
4. Click `Perform operations`. The dataset should now be the same as your other cleaned dataset.

For convenience, we used the same dataset. In reality you could use this process to clean related datasets. For example, data that you had collected over different fieldwork periods or data that was collected by different researchers (provided everyone uses the same column headings). 


## Saving and Exporting a Project

In OpenRefine you can save or export the project. This means you're saving the data and all the 
information about the cleaning and data transformation steps you've done. Once you've saved a project, you can
open it up again and be just where you stopped before.

### Saving

By default OpenRefine is saving your project. If you close OpenRefine and open it up again,
you'll see a list of your projects. You can click on any one of them to open it up again.

### Exporting

You can also export a project. This is helpful, for instance, if you wanted to send your raw data and cleaning steps to a collaborator, 
or share this information as a supplement to a publication. 

1. Click the `Export` button in the top right and select `Export project`.
2. A `tar.gz` file will download to your default `Download` directory. The `tar.gz` extension tells you that this is a compressed file.
Which means that this file contains multiple files. You can double-click on the `tar.gz` file and it will expand into a directory. A 
folder icon will now appear. 
3. Look at the files that appear in this folder. What files are here? What information do you think these files contain?

> ## Solution
> You should see:
> - a  `history` folder which contains three `zip` files. Each of these files itself contains a `change.txt` file. 
> These `change.txt` files are the records of each individual transformation that you did to your data. 
> - a `data.zip` file. When expanded, this `zip` file includes a file called `data.txt` which is a copy of your raw data.
> You may also see other files.
{: .solution}

You can import an existing project into OpenRefine by clicking `Open...` in the upper right > `Import Project` and selecting the `tar.gz` 
project file. This project will include all of the raw data and cleaning steps that were part of the origina project.

## Exporting Cleaned Data 

You can also export just your cleaned data, rather than the entire project.

1. Click `Export` in the top right and select the file type you want to export the data in. `Tab-separated values` (`tsv`) or `Comma-separated values` (`csv`) would be good choices.
2. That file will be exported to your default `Download` directory. That file can then be opened in a spreadsheet program or imported
into programs like R or Python, which we'll be discussing later in our workshop.

Remember from our lesson on Spreadsheets that using widely-supported, non-proprietary file formats like `tsv` or `csv` improves the ability of yourself and others to use your data.
