In this workshop, you will gain experience with common file formats,
data types, tools and programming languages used in educational 
research. You will learn how to perform critical steps in the data
analysis lifecycle reproducibly, saving yourself the tedium of 
performing repetitive and error-prone tasks by hand. From formatting
your data in ways that make it easy to work with, to data cleaning 
and visualization, you will get hands-on practice applying these 
tools to real-world educational data to solve common analysis 
problems.

After the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Use a spreadsheet program to format data tables in a computer-readable way.

- Use the R dplyr package to filter and subset datasets.

- Use the R ggplot package to visualize data.

- Describe the benefits of bringing Data Carpentry workshops to the DBER community.

> help one another and to apply what you have learned to your own 
> research problems. You will need a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or 
> Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you 
> have administrative privileges on. Instructions for installing 
> required software will be provided prior to the workshop. Workshop
